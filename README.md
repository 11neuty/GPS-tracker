## Project Description
This project is a GPS Tracker built using NEO-6M GPS Module and SIM800L Module. This GPS Tracker is designed to collect real-time location data and send it via a cellular network (SIM card) or via a Wi-Fi connection if the cellular signal is poor. 

This GPS Tracker has several key features, including:

1. **Real-Time Tracking**: This GPS Tracker can send real-time location information to the corresponding mobile application. This allows users to track the device accurately.

2. **Cellular Connection**: This project uses the SIM800L Module to send location data over the mobile network. Users can insert a SIM card into the device to activate this function.

3. **Wi-Fi Connection**: If the cellular signal is poor or unavailable, the GPS Tracker can switch to a Wi-Fi connection if available. This ensures that the device can still transmit location data.

4. **Mobile Apps**: There is a mobile application compatible with this GPS Tracker that allows users to view location data in real-time. The app has an easy-to-use interface and provides an interactive map to track the device.

## How to Use GPS Tracker

1. **SIM Card Installation**: Install the SIM card into the SIM800L Module and make sure the device gets enough mobile signal.

2. **Device Installation**: Install the GPS Tracker device in the place you want to track (for example, a vehicle). Make sure the device has good access to the open sky to get an accurate GPS signal.

3. **Mobile App**: Download and install the provided mobile application. Connect the app with the GPS Tracker device by following the instructions provided in the app.

4. **Real-Time Tracking**: You can now track the device in real-time via the mobile app. You will receive regular location updates.
